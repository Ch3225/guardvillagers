- Fix bug with guards eating food
- Fix stray white pixels in guard menu
- Removed Illusioners spawning in raids
    This would be better in a separate mod + changes in Neoforge make it completely unconfigurable
- Fixed guards not spawning in villages
- Added config for modpack makers to prevent guards from patrolling villages naturally
    - With a large amount of guards this could've caused lots of lag
